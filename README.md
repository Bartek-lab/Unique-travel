Technologies:
- HTML,
- CSS,
- JavaScript.

Description:

The idea of making this project was to improve my skills, which I have learned since I started my web development journey. Technologies which I used are fundamentals, but that was the point. I tried to do my best and see if I have learned them well from the tutorials. I know that practice is the best way to learn front-end skills. The theme of website is random, I have materials like photos etc. to do it so it was simple choice for a first time. Design was made in Figma, I tried to sketch on the beginning but I quickly gave up in favor of Figma which was recommended to me by my friend.

What I learned in practice?

Of course on the way of making this project I encountered many issues. I decided to don't give up and keep doing my job. 

I improved things like :

- Figma,
- HTML AND CSS,
- responsive web design,
- DOM manipulation (JS),
- compression of png photos,
- Github (first repository),
- using terminal to operate Github,
- I made website actually works on netlify,
- using strict mode nad prettier.


I will gladly take any word of constructive criticism.
